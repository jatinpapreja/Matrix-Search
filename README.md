Second line of each test case consists of N*M space separated integers denoting the elements in the matrix in row major order. Third line of each test case contains a single integer x, the element to be searched.

Constraints:
1 <= N,M <= 30 0 <= A[i] <= 100

Output Format
Print 1 if the element is present in the matrix, else 0.
